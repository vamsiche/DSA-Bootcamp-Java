## Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
start
n=2024
if n%==4:
   output leap year
else:
    output not leap year
stop

2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
start
a=2
b=3
c=a+b
print c
stop


3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
start
n=5
i=1
if i<=10:
    print i*n
    i=i+1
stop


 4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
start

a=2
b=3
  








5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.
start
sum=0
if n==x:
   print sum of all numbers
stop
